About This Project
===========

WhichMethod is a research study of <a href="http://www.healthsolutions.org" target="_blank">Public Health Solutions</a> in New York City.

The decision-making process of choosing a contraceptive method is complex, particularly for young women and women with low educational attainment. This intervention addresses this decision-making gap, by helping women of all literacy levels engage in the process of choosing a contraceptive method, thus reducing their risk of unintended pregnancy.

There are two key components to this decision-making module, including:

	1. Interactive Contraceptive Assessment; and 
	2. Tailored Feedback. 

The Interactive Contraceptive Assessment module is available in both Spanish and English and includes approximately 50 questions on sexual risk factors, contraceptive history, preferences and priorities, and medical history. Responses to the module questions guide an underlying algorithm that makes more than 500 ranking decisions for 19 different contraceptive methods. Users receive individually-tailored feedback about contraceptive methods that best fit given responses.
