  p <strong>Condoms</strong> can be used by themselves or with other birth control methods. Condoms can prevent pregnancy. Latex condoms can protect you from HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) like chlamydia, syphilis and gonorrhea. Use a new condom for each sext act.

  p If you forget to use birth control or your birth control method fails, ask your healthcare provider about <strong>Emergency Contraception</strong> (EC, also called Plan B). Emergency contraception is NOT a regular method of birth control. You have to take the EC pills starting within three days (72 hours) after having unprotected sex. Plan B One-Step, Next Choice Once Dose and some other brands of emergency contraception can be purchased over the counter without a presecription.
